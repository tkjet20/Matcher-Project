## Welcome

If you're reading this, that means we liked you enough to ask you to another round of interviewing. Congratulations!

Now let's get down to programming...

You will be graded by the following criteria:
- Code Readability:  How readable is your code
- Code Structure: How well did you structure your code
- Code Extensability: Is it easy for developers to extend your code, maintain it and add new features
- Solution Accuracy: Your solution should be accurate, not too many false positives and false negatives
- Solution Efficiency: Performance and efficiency of your solution [O(N) - Time Complexity & Space Complexity]

## The Match Game

You receive movie data feeds from many different providers, ex: Google Play, VUDU, Amazon Instant.
These include information about the availability of a given movie or TV show. 
They also usually include some metadata from  the movie, such as the title, director, and release year, alongside availability information like price and the fulfilment URL.

How do you take metadata and availability information found in these provider feeds and match them to an internal database of movies? 
Different feeds have varying types of metadata and there are inconsistencies between sources of data.

In this exercise, you will be given a database of movies and a provider feed. 
You must implement your own matching algorithm to match availability information to the internal database of movies.

## Getting Started 

You will find some files given to you to start off. Feel free to bring in any additional libraries that you feel will help
you accomplish this task.

## Data Files

**movies.csv** : a comma-separated file of around 200,000 movies, with the following schema:

| id | title | year |
| ------------ | ----- | ---- |
| 1            | Finding Nemo | 2006 |

**actors_and_directors.csv**: a comma-separated file of actors and directors associated with each movie. It has the following schema:

| movie_id | name | role |
| ------------ | ---- | -------- |
| 1            | Leonardo DiCaprio | cast |
| 2            | Martin Scorsese | director|

**xbox.csv**: a comma-separated file of the official provider feed for Xbox. It has the following schema:

| MediaId | Title | OriginalReleaseDate | MediaType | Actors | Director | XboxLiveURL |
| ------- | ----- | ------------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 531b964f-0cb9-4968-9b77-e547f2435225| Furious 7 | 4/13/2015 | Movie | Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jason Statham | James Wan | video.xbox.com
